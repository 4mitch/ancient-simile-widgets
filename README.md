# ancient-simile-widgets
This is the original simile repository exported from code.google.com/p/simile-widgets

Development of the simile-widgets toolset, including timeline and exhibit, 
took place on code.google.org.  With that site shutting down, we've migrated the
code repository here.  

Some of this code is still current---for example, the current simile-widgets 
timeline code is still here.  But the exhibit library is now superseded by the 
new simile-widgets repository created on github ( http://github.com/simile-widgets/exhibit ). 

Over time, we hope to extract key submodules of this one (such as the timeline) into their 
own evolving github repositories.
